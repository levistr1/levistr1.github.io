<h3>My Contributions to the Zelda Game</h3>

<h4>Weapon System</h4>
<p>I developed the weapon system, which functioned off of a main weapon component, as well as components
    for each individual weapon that would call functions from the main weapon comoponent on initialization.
    This allowed weapons like the bow, sword (at full health), and boomerand to share a singular function for 
    projectile movement, with some modifiers built in to accomodate each weapon's special functions.
</p>

<h4>Room Detection</h4>
<p>I designed the room detection system, which drops items (like a key for a locked door) only after every 
    enemy in the room has been cleared. This room detection system also ensures that the weapons are destroyed when
    they leave the room to prevent them from hitting enemies in other rooms. In addition, there are certain doors that
    are not opened with a key, but are only opened when every enemy in the room has been cleared. These doors were also 
    implemented with the room detection system</p>

<h4>Game UI</h4>
<p>I designed the user interface for the game, which displays the current primary and secondary weapons equipped, as well as
    any items the player has in their posession. The UI also displays the player's health and any keys they have available to them.
    The UI sits on a black backdrop to prevent the player from seeing into any rooms they are not currently standing in.
