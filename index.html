<h3>My Contributions to the Zelda Game</h3>

<h4>Weapon System</h4>
<p>I developed the weapon system, which functioned off of a main weapon component, as well as components
    for each individual weapon that would call functions from the main weapon comoponent on initialization.
    This allowed weapons like the bow, sword (at full health), and boomerand to share a singular function for 
    projectile movement, with some modifiers built in to accomodate each weapon's special functions.
